This mod enables Minimap to Show Detected Monster. (via sneak or any other method of detection)
And also display detection radius. **The detection radius includes the highlighted tile.**


With new builds allowing for detection range larger than your screen, I think it is fair to add feature like this.

Changelog:

v1.1:

Will now also display detection radius. The detection radius includes the highlighted tile.
Also make monster detection work with quasidetector.
